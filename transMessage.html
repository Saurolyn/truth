                <p>I've tried to write this a thousand times in my head, but the words always got stuck—tangled up in fear and hope and the crushing weight of <em>what if</em>. What if you don't understand? What if this changes everything between us? But I can't stay silent anymore. This isn't a phase or a passing thought. It's who I am, in a way I can't ignore any longer.</p>
                <p>What I'm about to say might surprise you. If you need to pause, that's okay. Just promise you'll come back to it with an open mind. Please don't shut down. Hear me out.</p>
                <p>I want to be transgender. Or at the very least, I know I want to live as a girl. Writing that feels terrifying—not because I'm ashamed, but because I'm afraid of losing you. Losing the way you see me. But pretending is breaking me, too.</p>
                <p>Here's the thing: I don't <em>hate</em> being a boy. It's not like I wake up every day despising my body or my voice. But there's always been this quiet ache, like I'm wearing clothes that don't quite fit. Like I'm watching life through a window, pressed against the glass. When I see girls—how they move, how they laugh, how they exist in the world—it's not just admiration. It's <em>longing</em>. A homesickness for a life I was supposed to have. I don't just think they're pretty; I want to <em>be</em> them. The shape of them, the softness, the way they take up space. I want the long hair, the curves, the way a dress hangs on hips I don't have yet. Sometimes I look at my body and grieve for something I've never even had.</p>
                <p>And when I let myself imagine it—when I daydream about a different name, a different reflection—it's like an electric jolt of <em>rightness</em>. Like finally scratching an itch I could never reach. It's euphoria. It's <em>me</em>.</p>
                <p>I'm not giving up being a man like some tragic sacrifice. I'll still mow the grass, still do the heavy lifting (though maybe not <em>too</em> heavy anymore). I'm still <em>me</em>—the same person you've always known. But I'm also uncovering a voice that's been shoved under the rug every time the world demanded masculinity from me. This voice has always been there. I just didn't have the words for it until now.</p>
                <p>I don't have everything figured out. I don't know how long this will take—months, years, a lifetime. I know the trans community faces cruelty I can't even fathom yet. But I'm not hurting anyone. No one in history has ever died from gender-affirming care. I just want to <em>exist</em> as the person I've always been underneath. To support others like me, and to live without this constant ache of <em>almost</em>.</p>
                <p>I'm telling you because I love you too much to lie. Because you deserve to know the real me, not the version I built out of fear. I need your support, your love, even your confusion—just not your silence. If you're scared or angry, tell me. Ask me anything. I can take messy. What I can't take is losing you.</p>
                <p>This isn't an ending. It's me showing up, fully, for the first time. I'm not changing in the ways that matter most—my heart, my memories, the way I love you. If anything, I'm finally giving you the truth.</p>
                <p>I love you. More than anything. And I hope, more than anything, you'll still love me too.</p>

                        <p>It's a deep, persistent feeling that my assigned gender doesn't match who I am inside. Small moments—like cringing when called "sir" or feeling euphoria when expressing femininity—keep confirming it. It's not about disliking being male, but about feeling more like myself when I embrace being a woman.</p>

                        <p>The signs were always there, but I pushed them away for years. Recently, the discomfort became impossible to ignore. Experimenting with feminine expression (like growing my nails or imagining life as a woman, wearing feminine underwear underneath my masculine clothing [don't worry, Ems, I didn't steal anything from you], etc…) brought me so much joy that I couldn't deny it anymore.</p>

                        <p><strong>Medically:</strong> Hormone therapy (estrogen) to develop feminine traits like softer skin and curves. I've researched this extensively and will work with doctors and therapists to do it the right way.</p>

                    all whitewashed stone and spiral stairs,<br>
                    my ribs the cage around the flame.<br>
                    The lantern room turns, turns, turns,<br>
                    painting the fog with gold.<br>
                    <em>This is what safety looks like,</em><br>
                    I tell the ships. <em>Steer toward me.</em>

                    But the darkness comes.<br>
                    Not from the sea, but from below—<br>
                    up the stairs, step by patient step,<br>
                    a tide of black ink rising.<br>
                    It licks at my ankles first,<br>
                    cold as deadnames in strangers' mouths.<br>
                    Then higher: the cling of wet wool<br>
                    (a binder worn three days too long),<br>
                    the choke of collar bones<br>
                    remembering how they used to jut.

                <p>
                    I feed the flame. Throw open<br>
                    the medicine cabinet mirror—<br>
                    <em>see her, see her, see her—</em><br>
                    but the dark has reached the landing now.<br>
                    It peels the posters from the walls<br>
                    (girls in sundresses, laughing),<br>
                    dissolves them like sugar in tea.<br>
                    The stairs creak under its weight.<br>
                    Always climbing. Always hungry.

                <p>
                    When it finds me in the lantern room,<br>
                    I'm clutching a vial of estrogen<br>
                    to my chest like a crucifix.<br>
                    The dark doesn't speak.<br>
                    It <em>unspools</em>—<br>
                    threads of shadow knitting themselves<br>
                    into my father's voice:<br>
                    <em>"You'll regret this."</em><br>
                    Into the news anchor's smirk:<br>
                    <em>"A phase."</em><br>
                    Into the bathroom scale<br>
                    that never shows the right number.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The flame gutters. For a heartbeat,<br>
                    I consider letting it die.<br>
                    How easy to step into the dark,<br>
                    let it wear my skin like an old coat.<br>
                    But then—<br>
                    a ship's horn in the distance.<br>
                    Somewhere, a trans girl<br>
                    is squinting through the storm,<br>
                    steering toward my light.<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    So I pour the vial into the lamp.<br>
                    The fire roars—<br>
                    not gold now, but <em>pink-blue-white</em>,<br>
                    the colors of our flag.<br>
                    The dark screams as it burns.<br>
                    It will return, of course.<br>
                    Darkness always does.<br>
                    But tonight, the beacon spins,<br>
                    and the sea whispers back:<br>
                    <em>Hold on. We're coming.</em>

                    like a letter with no address.<br>
                    <em>“Return to sender”</em> isn't an option.<br>
                    So I rewrite the envelope<br>
                    in the ink of my own blood—<br>
                    forward it to myself<br>
                    care of: <em>the future.</em></p>

                    <p>There exists a parallel world<br>
                    where I was born right.<br>
                    She brushes her hair by the window,<br>
                    unaware of the ghost<br>
                    who wears her face like a debt.<br>
                    We orbit each other,<br>
                    twin stars separated<br>
                    by the thinnest pane of glass.</p>

                    <div class="poem-title">Alchemy</div>
                    <p>
                        I look now, out my stained-glass terrace—<br>
                        its panes kissed by twilight's breath—<br>
                        and see the child I used to be,<br>
                        fingers twisting in hair too short,<br>
                        wishing it could spill like a river.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then, the vial.<br>
                        Dark as midnight, it trembles—<br>
                        and bursts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A sigh of light.<br>
                        His body unfolds: hips soften,<br>
                        hair cascades past his shoulders.<br>
                        For a breath, he is her.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then—the chains.<br>
                        They lash from shadows,<br>
                        slicing the transformation apart.<br>
                        Tissue tears. Hair falls.<br>
                        Back to the boy's tidy crop.<br>
                        Only the ribbons remain, defiant.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The lace comes after.<br>
                        Always after.<br>
                        Gilded thread weaves the vial whole,<br>
                        sealing cracks with filigree.<br>
                        A pretty repair.<br>
                        A lie that almost looks like love.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The child weeps.<br>
                        For the body that betrays them twice—<br>
                        once by changing,<br>
                        once by unchanging.<br>
                        And the terrace holds me,<br>
                        a witness to their alchemy.
